# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Weather App

## Overview
This is a simple **Weather App** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to input a city name and generates random weather conditions as a mock feature, as no external API is used.

## Features
- User-friendly interface
- Responsive design
- Randomized mock weather data
- Styled with modern UI enhancements

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage
- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic functionality and weather generation

## How It Works
1. User enters a city name in the input field.
2. Clicking the "Get Weather" button displays random weather data.
3. The app shows the city name, temperature, and a weather condition.

## File Structure
```
/weather-app
│── index.html  (Main HTML file)
│── styles.css  (Styling file for UI)
│── script.js   (JavaScript file for logic)
```

## Installation & Usage
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter a city name and get randomized weather details.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate a real weather API like OpenWeatherMap.
- Add geolocation support to fetch user's actual weather.
- Improve UI with additional animations and transitions.
